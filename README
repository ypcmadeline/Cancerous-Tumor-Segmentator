[ELEC4010N] Assignment-02, Problem 1

1. datas are stored in the format of .h5. use the function read_h5 in dataset.py to read data (image and label).

2. training data: ./datas/train/*.h5; testing data: ./datas/test/*.h5.

3. images have different shapes, so we suggest to randomly crop a sub-image with the same size (e.g., 112x112x80) as the input.

4. if your gpu/cpu has no enough memories, reduce the batch size or reduce the cropping size.

5. in test.py, sliding window strategy is adopted but some parts are missing such as model initialization and computation of evaluation metrics.

6. please submit the code with a readme file exmplaining the python environment (version, packages, cuda, ...), and how to run the code.
